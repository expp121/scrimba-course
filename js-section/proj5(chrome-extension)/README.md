# Intro
This is one of the many projects I had to do at scrimba's frontend course.
It's about using javascript, and the project is a chrome/brave/any chromium based browser extension which helps you save important links

# Run it

Go to your chrome extensions and enable developer mode.
After doing that, click the button `Load unpacked` and locate the directory of this project.

This will install the extension, and you are going to have a new extension in your bar.

Then go to a web page, and click the `Save tab` button, this will save the current URL of the webpage you are on.
Also, you can add manually a web page by typing its URL in the input field and click the `Save input` button.
