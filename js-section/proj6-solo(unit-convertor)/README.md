# Intro
This is one of the many projects I had to do at scrimba's frontend course.
It's about using javascript, and the project is a convertor from different metrics, such as from meters to miles and so on...

# Run it
Just open the `index.html`, and make sure the rest of the files are in the same folder. ðŸš€

OR

Test it [https://scrimba-converter.netlify.app/](https://scrimba-converter.netlify.app/).
