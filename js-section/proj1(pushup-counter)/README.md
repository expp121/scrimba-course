# Intro
This is one of the many projects I had to do at scrimba's frontend course.
It's about introducing javascript, and the project consists of a simple counter for pushups.

# Run it
Just open the `index.html`, and make sure the rest of the files are in the same folder. ðŸš€

OR

Test it here `https://pushup-counter-js.netlify.app/`.
